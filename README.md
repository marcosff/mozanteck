This is an answer to that exercice: https://github.com/Mozantech/store-parts-exercise

There are to ways to execute this, one and the best is use Vue, once the vue are installed, just go to the reporitory folder and execute:
npm install
npm run serve
And it will be running in http://localhost:8084

Just in case, in the folder dist you have the build, so you can run over there as a second but not recommended option.

But don't forget that this depends on "store-parts-exercise", so this repository must be running on port 8081 as was required ;)
